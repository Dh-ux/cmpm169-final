		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<p>The main concept of this lab was to learn how to pseudocode an everyday task before coding a computer task. </p>
	</div>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p> The problem we encounter is about how to write the pseudocode in right way.
	<h1>Challenge</h1>
	<p>	This one was not easy at first, when I went to Section, I understood better.Me and My partner have a great experenices</p>
</div>
	<h1>Result</h1>
	<p>This is the outline of our everyday task.</p>
	<pre><code>
		//Everyday task Play basketball
		//1.Driving to the gym
		//2.Pick up basketball
		//3.shoot the ball from three point line
		//4.shoot the ball from corner
		//5.Practice dribble
	</pre></code>
	<p> The is the pseudocoding of our computer task, which is a average-salary calculator.</p>
	<pre><code>
		// Inlitizlize salary_counter and sum =0
			// set the loop
				// Add each salary to the sum
				// Increment the counter
			// Loop through each salary
	   // compute average = sum/counter
	   // Print the average of salary
 </pre></code>
